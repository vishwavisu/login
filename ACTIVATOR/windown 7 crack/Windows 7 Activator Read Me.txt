Installation Tips
-----------------
- It is recommended to do a clean install of Windows 7 but not necessary as it has tested to work with upgrades as well.
- You must remove all modifications made by previous 7Loaders and Orbit30 Win7 Tool Kit (1.8 toolkit was for pre-RTM).
- Disable "UAC" to be safe.

1. Run the '7Loader' on your Windows Partition
2. Select your desired "OEM" Brand
3. Wait for the pop-up to appear
4. Click "Install 7Loader"
5. Wait for the pop-up to appear
6. Press "OK" and PC will reboot once complete

Special Notations
-----------------
- If you have a modded BIOS, instead of clicking "Install 7Loader".. you can just use the "SLIC 2.1 in BIOS" to install the certificate & key to activate without having to use the loader.
